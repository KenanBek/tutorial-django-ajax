tutorial-django-ajax
====================

Hi,

This code project is Django based project with contains sample application on different aspects of using AJAX in Python and Django environment.

I have a little bit changed structure of default Django project. Main change is renaming main folder to **configuraiton**. It contains:

* **settings.py** - main settings file
* **urls.py** - main URL configuraiton file
* **wsgi.py** - WSGI application module

Source code for each part of tutorial is in sample application folders (eg. sample1, sample2, etc.).
